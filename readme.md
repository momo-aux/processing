# Just some Processing sketches for WING 2 - INF

## FleaInTheDark  
A little game to bring all together (collision, gravity, vectors, ...):
- The torch beam follows the mouse.  
- Use A,W,D or arrow keys to move the flea (btw: the flea is called Mike ;-) ).
- Jump to the red Platform
- No death and no Goal yet.
- LevelBuilder can be used with * (not +)
